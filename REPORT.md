# Project 1: sshell üêö

## Introduction 
The goal of this project was to understand how to use UNIX system calls and implement a
simple command line interpreter using the C programming language and the GCC compiler.
Our shell accepts commands from user input and executes them. 
 
## Core Features‚ú®

- Execution of user supplied commands with optional arguments
- Execution of built-in system commands
- File manipulation
- Output redirection
- Piping support

## Functions
sshell uses a number of functions to work properly:

| Function | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- |
| split_string | Command line parsing |
| trimwhitespace | Command line parsing |
| parse_redirection | Command line parsing |
| background_check | Background jobs |
| setup_pipes | Process Piping |
| run_commands | Command execution |
| push | Job management |
| delete | Job management |


And of course the main function itself manages the calling of these functions

## High-level explanation
Sshell is a C program that implements a basic shell. It takes in user input,
parses it, and executes the command specified by the user. Sshell background
execution, redirection, and piping. It also has a linked list implementation to
keep track of background processes. The program uses various standard C
libraries such as unistd.h, stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, sys/wait.h, stdbool.h
and ctype.h for various operations such as forking, execution, memory
allocation, string manipulation, and error handling. 

Our program starts by defining several constants such as the maximum length of the
command line, the maximum number of pipes, and the maximum number of arguments. It also
includes several header files such as stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, unistd.h, and sys/
wait.h which are used for various purposes such as input/output operations, memory
allocation, string manipulation, and job (process) management.
 
### Data Structures
Our defined struct, Job, contains two fields, cmd and pid, which store the command and
the process ID of the job, respectively. The second struct, Node, contains three
fields, data, next, and prev. The data field holds the job data, and the next and prev
fields are used to implement a linked list to store the jobs. The Node struct is used
to create a linked list of Jobs and contains a Job struct as well as a pointer to the
next Node. There are several functions implemented to manipulate the linked list such
as push() and delete(). The push function is used to add a new job to the linked list.
Then, the function takes a pointer to the head of the list and a struct Job as
arguments. A new node is created and allocated memory, and the data is assigned to the
new node. The new node is then inserted at the beginning of the list. The delete
function is used to remove a job from the linked list. The function takes a pointer to
the head of the list and an integer, pid, as arguments. Then we traverse the list until
it finds the node with the pid equal to the provided pid, and then it removes the node
from the list by adjusting the pointers.


### Main
The main function of the code is the starting point of execution. It is responsible for 
coordinating the overall flow of the program, including initializing variables and
objects, calling other functions, and handling any input/output. In this code, the main
function performs several key tasks. 

First, it initializes any necessary variables and objects that will be used throughout
the program. This may include creating instances of classes, setting default values,
and allocating memory. Next, the main function calls other functions in the program to
perform specific tasks. These functions may handle tasks such as data processing, user
input/output, or calculations. The main function coordinates these calls and ensures
that they are executed in the correct order.


The main contains a while loop that repeatedly prompts the user for a command and then
processes it. The command is checked for a background job indicator '&' using the
background_check() function. If the indicator is present, the command is executed in
the background, otherwise, it is executed and completes immediately before showing a
new shell prompt. The command is first passed through a function called trimwhitespace
() which removes any leading and trailing whitespaces. Then we have basic error
mangement to check if arguments were placed correctly. Then, we check if pipe operators
are present and if so we handle the piping between commands by entering our pipe for
loop.


### Command execution
Run_commands() uses the execvp() function to execute the command with the given
arguments. If the command is a built-in command such as 'cd' or 'exit', the program
handles it accordingly. If the command is executed in the background, the process ID is
stored in a Job struct and added to the linked list of background jobs. The
background_check function is defined which takes 2 arguments, cmd and error. The
function checks if the command has a background sign '&' and if it is placed correctly
at the end of the command. If it is correctly placed, it replaces the '&' character
with the null character and returns false, otherwise it prints an error message and
sets the error variable to 1, and returns true.

### Piping
This block of code is responsible for creating child processes and setting up pipes to
handle commands that are passed in as input. The for loop iterates through each command
in the pipe_commands array, starting at the last command and working its way to the
first.Within the loop, the pipe function is called to create a pipe for each command,
and then a fork is performed to create a new child process.

  * If the return value of fork is 0, it means that the code is running in the child
  process, and the child process's pipe is set up using the setup_pipes function, and
  the command is executed using the run_commands function.
  

  * If the return value of fork is greater than 0, it means that the code is running in
  the parent process, and the parent process closes the pipe and records the process ID
  of the child process.

  * If fork returns a negative value, it means that there was an error creating the
  child process and the program exits with an error code.

  * If there are no pipe commands, the run_commands function is called to execute the
  single command without piping. And the retval is set to the return value of the
  run_commands function.
  
### Background Jobs
The background_check function is responsible for checking the status of background
processes. It does this by calling the waitpid() function with the WNOHANG option,
which allows the function to check the status of a child process without blocking. If
the child process has terminated, the function will update the status of the process in
the jobs list and print a message indicating that the process has completed. If the
child process has not terminated, the function will do nothing. This function is
typically called periodically by the main loop of the program, allowing it to check the
status of background processes and update the user on their status. Overall, this
function provides the functionality for monitoring and managing background processes.


The program also has a signal handler which is invoked when a child process terminates.
The signal handler uses the waitpid() function to wait for the child process to
terminate and retrieves the process ID of the terminated process. It then uses the
delete() function to remove the corresponding Job from the linked list of background
jobs.

# Testing

_Test cases included in tester.sh_

* To test sshell, we wrote test functions to check for potential errors when
using output redirection, missing commands, exit status of piped commands, and
accessing fake directories.

* First, we tested for an incorrect file path during output redirection by
creating a test function that attempted to redirect output to a file with a
non-existent path. The function checked for an error message or exception,
indicating that the file path was incorrect.

* Next, we wrote a test function to check for a missing command by attempting
to run a command that did not exist. The function checked for an error message
or exception, indicating that the command was not found.

* We also wrote a test function to check if piped commands would display exit
status, by running a command that included a pipe and checking the output for
the exit status.

* We then tested piped commands with output redirection, by redirecting the
output of a piped command to a file, and checking if the output was correctly
written to the file.

* We also wrote test function to check if piped commands exits correctly, by
running a command that included a pipe and checking the exit status.

* Finally, we wrote a test function to check if the program could handle
accessing a false directory that did not exist and checking for an error
message or exception.

* Overall, these test functions were used to ensure that your project could
handle a variety of potential errors and function correctly in different
scenarios.
